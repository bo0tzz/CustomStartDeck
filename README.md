# CustomStartRelics  
This is a mod for the Peglin Demo that lets you always start
with specific relics.

This mod is imperfect and comes with no warranties. It may break your game,
prevent you from creating new savefiles, crash your computer, or set your house on fire.

3. Place CustomStartRelics.dll in the `BepInEx/plugins` folder, inside the game folder

## Configuration
